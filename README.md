keephpass
=========

create, read and write keepass databases

got stuck due to other projects. hopefully this works end of 2015. stay tuned :)

working perl module: https://metacpan.org/pod/File::KeePass

maybe this can be ported.. 

at https://www.keepassx.org/downloads/ there is the source code from keepassX..
